EXPLORE CANCER VARIANTS
==================

Small collection of analysis scripts that generate summary plots and tables
for somatic cancer variants. The scripts read a single annotated TSV file and
produce plots saved to `visualize_variants/plots/`.

Contents
--------
- `scripts/gnomAD_freq.py` — gnomAD allele frequency distributions by
	oncogenicity class and combined KDE plots.
- `scripts/oncogenicity.py` — counts and barplot of variant oncogenicity
	classes.
- `scripts/top_genes.py` — top genes by variant counts for different
	oncogenicity classes and class distributions for top genes.
- `scripts/variants_in_domain.py` — analyses of variants inside protein
	domains, enrichment per domain, and gene×domain heatmaps.
- `scripts/variants_in_func_sites.py` — analyses of variants in functional
	protein sites (binding sites, modified residues, regions, etc.) and
	related gene-level summaries.
- `scripts/variants_in_hotspots.py` — analyses of variants in cancer
	hotspots and gene-level hotspot enrichment.

Input data
----------
All scripts expect the annotated variant table at:

`annotation_pipeline/output/variants_with_func_sites.tsv`

This file must contain columns used by the scripts such as `ONCOGENIC`,
`Hugo_Symbol`, `gnomAD_AF`, `IN_FUNC_SITE`, `FEATURE_TYPE`, `DOMAIN_NAME`,
`Hotspot_Type` and others. If you don't have this file, run your annotation
pipeline that produces `variants_with_func_sites.tsv` before running the
visualization scripts.

Outputs
-------
All plots are saved to `visualize_variants/plots/` (the scripts create this
folder when needed). Each script also prints short summaries and shows the
plot interactively (they call `plt.show()`). 

Requirements
------------
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy (used by `gnomAD_freq.py`)


Notes and suggestions
---------------------
- The scripts are lightweight analysis/plotting scripts intended for
	exploratory use. They do not provide CLI argument parsing; consider
	adding `argparse` if you want to change inputs/outputs.

Where to find things
--------------------
- Scripts: `scripts/`
- Plots: `visualize_variants/plots/`
- Expected input TSV: `annotation_pipeline/output/variants_with_func_sites.tsv`
